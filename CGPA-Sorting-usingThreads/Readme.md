# Odd-Even Transposition Sort using Threads
This assignment is an implementation of the odd-even transposition sort algorithm using threads in Java. The objective of this assignment is to compare the time taken to sort an array of CGPA values using the traditional single-threaded implementation and a multi-threaded implementation using two threads (one thread for odd-indexed elements and another thread for even-indexed elements).
## Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of Java programming<br>
Familiarity with threading concepts in Java<br>
A development environment with the latest version of Java installed
## Functionalities
Sorting an array of CGPA values using the traditional single-threaded implementation<br>
Sorting an array of CGPA values using a multi-threaded implementation using two threads<br>
Comparing the time taken to sort the array using the two implementations
## Classes
Collecting: This class collects and stores randomly generated CGPAs to an array<br>
withThread: This class implements the multi-threaded implementation of the odd-even transposition sort algorithm<br>
